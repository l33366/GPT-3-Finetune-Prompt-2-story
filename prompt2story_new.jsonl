{"prompt":"You are given a deal by a higher power that grants you eternal life . The catch ? You have to kill one person every year . If you fail do do so , even a minute too late , you will die .\n\nSTORY\n\n","completion":" Killing has always been easy . Crossing the Atlantic , the deal I made , I have had little trouble meeting my quota . I often *exceeded* it in my trek to western America . I garnered various fortunes and identities throughout the years . In my time spent crossing the plains , I would go months without seeing a soul , only to kill the first one with a rifle shot , or an invite to camp followed by a midnight stabbing , the times were tougher then as they say .  It was easy to kill in lawless California . People lost touch with their gods this far from the homeland , which was interesting to me . When I first made this deal , and then killed , the people of the towns would react piously . People would blame demons , my actions would go unchecked when I would leave some weird affect behind . For fifteen years my killings in Pennsylvania were blamed on a `` Vampire '' . But the machines killed god .  By the turn of century there was so much opportunity god was n't needed and people became cynical and wary of my actions . No blame was placed upon the supernatural , and I became careful . It was still easy . It always will be . END"}
{"prompt":"You get a deep cut for the first time in your life , instead of bone or muscle , you see wires .\n\nSTORY\n\n","completion":" Awesome prompt ! I usually find prompts boring but this one was very interesting and had a lot of potential , so thankyou for posting this .   One disclaimer I wrote this from my phone . I proofread very carefully but I always miss something so do n't kill me guys , autocorrect sucks . Also words like dont and didnt where there should be an apostrophe dont always have an apostrophe because as I said , auto correct on my phone is literally braindead .   End of my disclaimer , the story 's below , thanks for reading btw , I hope you enjoy !   Thoughts raced through my mind with the speed of a concord jet as I contemplated how I was still alive . The fall must have been at least ten stories , and I could n't feel anything from the waist down . The panic of a man crippled racked my brain . If I survived , would I be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of my life ? Would I ever be able to make love to my wife again ? Would I be a broken handicap , scootering about in a chair , unable to use the bathroom without aid , unable to walk or enjoy the out doors ? Would I be able to work or drive my old dodge challenger or mow my lawn or walk my dog ? Would I have to use one of those vans with the ramps ? Would I need to go on disability ? What would my life look like from the seat of a chair ? That was assuming I would even survive long enough to see rescue . My life was no certain prospect . END"}

Life worked out . Life went on . People got annoyed but forgave me . Thankfully my boss was a lenient man .   At 70 I finally retired . A bit late to that as well , but I got to enjoy my golden years with my lovely wife and grand children . Despite being related to me , no one in my family seemed to catch my curse . The kids were always punctual , probably because they saw how late their old man was for their entire life .   Laying on my bed surrounded by my family , I reflected on my life . END"}
