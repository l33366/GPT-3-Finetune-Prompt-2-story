# GPT-3-Finetune-Prompt-2-story
Here The Gpt 3 was fine tuned for the task for taking a prompt then completing the story.


Here we use the dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ratthachat/writing-prompts 


This dataset consisted of prompt and the story followed by it.


Here the Python file with name "NLP_GPT_prompt2story_dataset_framing" is used for converting the text file containing the story and prompt into a jasonl file 


File "gpt3Finetune.ipynb" is the fine tuning done on that gpt 3 model.
