On arrival, the front desk clerk tells them that the hotel is temporarily closed for maintenance, but will reopen in one hour. Soon after, the group notices a mysterious woman, who identifies herself as Elvira, standing in the hallway. She invites the group to her room and explains that she is a former resident of the hotel who was ostracized by her friends and family after she wrote a series of ghost stories. The doors abruptly lock, and a loud crash is heard. Realizing the woman is telling the truth, the friends escape the hotel through a window, but are separated and end up stranded on an isolated stretch of road located deep in the forest.\n",

She offers the group a ride home in her car, but they refuse and she drives away. Later that day, a police officer informs the group that the hotel is open for business and offers to take them there, but they decide to walk. They find a car battery and decide to use it as a phone battery by hooking it up to their car. As they are about to leave, the battery explodes in their faces, and one of the friends is hit in the face with a golf club. He is knocked unconscious, and when he regains consciousness, he finds that his hands have been severed. He manages to call the police, and when they arrive, the group is forced to flee from the officers and escape to the road.\n",
